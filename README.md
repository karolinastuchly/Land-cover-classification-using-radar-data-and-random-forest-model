Overview:
These scripts provide functionalities for processing geospatial data, including satellite imagery, shapefiles, and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. They encompass various tasks such as data extraction, preprocessing, classification, evaluation, and visualization.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:

For general geospatial processing: glob, json, pprint, pandas, geopandas, rasterio, numpy, folium, rioxarray, datetime, shapely
For SAR data processing: cv2, imageio, osgeo, multiprocessing
For Random Forest Classifier: scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
For SAR classification and evaluation: scikit-learn, geopandas, seaborn, rasterio
Setup:
Ensure all required Python libraries are installed using pip. Place your data files in appropriate directories and update the file paths in the scripts accordingly.

Usage:
Run the scripts in a Python environment according to your specific task.

Notes:
Customize file paths, parameters, and settings based on your data and requirements.
Additional customization and optimization can be done for specific use cases and preferences.
File Structure:
Each script has its own Python file.
Directories may include input data, output files, and intermediate results specific to the script's functionality.
Outputs:
Outputs include processed data files, visualization outputs (such as maps, confusion matrices, ROC curves), and evaluation metrics.
Disclaimer:
These scripts provide a framework for geospatial data processing and analysis. Ensure proper data handling practices and validate results according to your project's requirements.
