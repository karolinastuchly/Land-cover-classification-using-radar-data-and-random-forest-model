Overview:
This script extracts several indices from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data stored in a CSV file. It calculates indices such as VV/VH ratio, VH/VV ratio, NDPI (Normalized Difference Polarization Index), POL Index (Polarization Index), DPSVI (Dual-Polarization Synthetic Vegetation Index), and DPSVIm (Modified Dual-Polarization Synthetic Vegetation Index) for each date specified in the column names.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, re
Setup:
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy
Place your CSV file containing SAR data in the appropriate directory.

Usage:
Modify the script to specify the input CSV file path.

Run the script in a Python environment:

python extract_indices.py
The script will perform the following steps:

Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Extract column names with dates.
Calculate various indices (VV/VH ratio, VH/VV ratio, NDPI, POL Index, DPSVI, DPSVIm) for each date.
Concatenate the new indices dataframes with the original dataframe.
Save the updated dataframe with indices as a new CSV file.
Inputs:
CSV File: Input data file containing SAR data with column names formatted as dates.
Outputs:
INDEKSY.csv: CSV file containing SAR data with additional calculated indices.
Notes:
Ensure that the CSV file is properly formatted with numerical SAR data.
Adjust the file path in the script according to your data.
