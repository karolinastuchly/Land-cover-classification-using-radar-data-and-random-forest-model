Overview:
These code snippets demonstrate hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier using grid search with cross-validation. The goal is to find the optimal hyperparameters that maximize the accuracy of the classifier on the training dataset.

Code Explanation:
1. Tuning n_estimators and max_features:
Define a range of values for n_estimators and max_features.
Set up a grid search using GridSearchCV to search over the specified parameter grid.
Perform cross-validation using StratifiedKFold with 3 folds.
Fit the grid search object to the training data and obtain the best hyperparameters and corresponding accuracy score.
2. Tuning max_depth:
Define a range of values for max_depth.
Set up a grid search using GridSearchCV to search over the specified parameter grid.
Perform cross-validation using StratifiedKFold with 3 folds.
Fit the grid search object to the training data and obtain the best hyperparameters and corresponding accuracy score.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: scikit-learn
Usage:
Define the range of values for hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_features, max_depths).
Run the code snippets in a Python environment.
Check the output to find the best hyperparameters and accuracy score for each tuning.
Inputs:
feature_important: Features of the dataset.
target: Target variable of the dataset.
Outputs:
Best hyperparameters and accuracy score for the Random Forest Classifier.
Notes:
Ensure that the dataset (feature_important, target) is correctly formatted and preprocessed before performing hyperparameter tuning.
Adjust the range of hyperparameters and cross-validation settings based on the specific requirements of your problem.
