Overview:
This script uses Random Forest Classifier to classify geospatial data into various land cover classes. It preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest Classifier model, evaluates the model performance, and visualizes the results.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, geopandas, shapely
Setup:
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib geopandas shapely
Place your training data CSV file and shapefile with point geometry in the appropriate directories.

Usage:
Run the script in a Python environment:

python random_forest_classifier.py
The script will perform the following steps:

Preprocess the training data.
Train a Random Forest Classifier model.
Evaluate the model performance using confusion matrix, classification report, and overall accuracy.
Visualize the confusion matrix and correlation matrix.
Save the trained model and classification results as shapefiles.
File Structure:
random_forest_classifier.py: The main Python script for Random Forest Classifier.
lasyrazem.csv: Training data CSV file containing features and target classes.
false_classification.shp: Shapefile containing falsely classified points.
true_classification.shp: Shapefile containing correctly classified points.
correlation_matrix.png: Visualization of the correlation matrix.
confusion_matrix.png: Visualization of the confusion matrix.
Outputs:
false_classification.shp: Shapefile containing falsely classified points.
true_classification.shp: Shapefile containing correctly classified points.
correlation_matrix.png: Visualization of the correlation matrix.
confusion_matrix.png: Visualization of the confusion matrix.
Notes:
Ensure that the training data is properly preprocessed and formatted.
Adjust the file paths in the script according to your directory structure and file names.
Additional preprocessing steps or feature engineering can be added as needed.
