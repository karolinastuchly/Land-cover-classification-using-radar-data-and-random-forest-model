Overview:
This script visualizes the feature space by creating a scatter plot of two selected columns from a CSV file. It also removes outliers based on standard deviation and scales the data using Min-Max scaling.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn
Setup:
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
Place your CSV file containing the data in the appropriate directory.

Usage:
Modify the script to specify the input CSV file path and the columns to be plotted (x_column and y_column).

Run the script in a Python environment:

python feature_space_visualization.py
The script will perform the following steps:

Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Normalize the selected columns using Min-Max scaling (optional).
Remove outliers based on standard deviation.
Create a scatter plot of the selected columns, color-coded by class.
Save the plot as a JPG image.
File Structure:
feature_space_visualization.py: The main Python script for feature space visualization.
lasyrazem.csv: Input CSV file containing the data.
[x_column]_[y_column]_scaled_no_outliers.jpg: Output scatter plot image.
Inputs:
CSV File: Input data file containing columns to be visualized.
Outputs:
[x_column]_[y_column]_scaled_no_outliers.jpg: Scatter plot image showing the feature space.
Notes:
Ensure that the CSV file is properly formatted with numerical data.
Adjust the file paths and column names in the script according to your data.
Modify the color and labels for each class in the script's dictionary (class_info) as needed.
