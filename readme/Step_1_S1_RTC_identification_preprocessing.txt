Overview:
This script is designed to process geospatial data, including satellite imagery, shapefiles, and metadata files. It performs various tasks such as reading shapefiles, counting files, analyzing metadata, merging datasets, and visualizing geospatial data on interactive maps.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: glob, json, pprint, pandas, geopandas, rasterio, numpy, folium, rioxarray, datetime, shapely
Setup:
Ensure that all required Python libraries are installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install geopandas rasterio numpy folium rioxarray shapely
Place your data files in appropriate directories and update the file paths in the script accordingly.

Usage:
Run the script in a Python environment.

The script will execute various tasks such as reading shapefiles, counting files, analyzing metadata, merging datasets, and visualizing geospatial data.

Check the output files generated by the script for further analysis or visualization.

File Structure:
geospatial_script.py: The main Python script for geospatial data processing.
shapefiles/: Directory containing shapefiles used in the analysis.
metadata/: Directory containing metadata files.
output/: Directory containing output files generated by the script.
merged/: Directory containing merged datasets.
Outputs:
output/*.csv: CSV files containing processed data and analysis results.
merged/*.tif: Merged raster datasets.
maps/*.html: Interactive maps displaying geospatial data overlays.
Notes:
Make sure to update file paths and other parameters according to your specific data and requirements.
Additional customization and optimization can be done based on specific use cases and preferences.
